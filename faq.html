            A website with an easy-to-follow user interface. Links to other pages are appended in areas where any content consumer should most intuitively be able to find them. Besides that, a good website is one that communicates a clear central theme.
            As such, the linguistic tone of any website must be appropriate to the target consumer, and ring consistent with the design elements of the website (layput/colour scheme/images used etc.)

            Broadly speaking, web accessibility refers to the ability for people with disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the website. Accessible design improves overall user experience and satisfaction, especially in a variety of situations, across different devices, and for older users. Accessibility can enhance your brand, drive innovation, and extend your market reach.
            Witin this website, the absence of complex navigation trees makes this website easy enough to navigate for people who would typically find using technology challenging (i.e. the elderly). The minimal use of sharp colour contrasts and the widespread use of bright,pastel colours in the website helps people with visual impairments imposes very little strain on the eye, thereby allowing people with eyesight problems to decipher content quite comfortably from the website.The absence of features coloured red and green next to each other makes for a comfortable read amongst consumers with red-green colour blindness

            GDPR is a revised data protection legislation by the EU. It mandates organisations to protect personal data, and provide proof of how data is protected. The GDPR establishes
            establishes a high standard of consent to enable consumers of online content to be fully informed as to how their personal data would be processed by third-party organisations, and hence, empowers
            themselves to make secure choices with regards to the sharing and transmission of their personal data. Future considerations to be made to protect the security of the data of our site visitors would be to introduce
            a pop-up that details our policy of data use to them before they click onto our website. Also, should they choose to share their contact information with us via the'Contact Us' page, we would endeavour to keep our
            site users up to date with revisions to our data-use policy via e-mail correspondences.

            We could potentially explore three methods of marketing:-
            a) Method 1: Create good content in our social media accounts and link our website to the written posts
            b) Method 2: Cheesy infomercials are the way to go! Not because *ahem* users actually *ahem* retain information from them, but because they are so cringe-worthy that our brand image gets cemented in their minds.
            c) Method 3: Paid traffic re-direction via ad platforms (Costly option and will only be explored when a continuous revenue stream is seen.)

          In future, I'd have social media hyperlinks embedded within the website. I would also make a page of audio recordings on the individual pages of the website
          to improve our accessibility to the visually impaired.

            GitHub repositories were used because it provides a free web-hosting service which affords any organisation with a unique domain name without having to string along the
            hosting service's name in the URL. It is also capable of seamlessly auto-syncing with the ATOM web editor when changes are made to the website. In short, it was chosen
            for its simplicity of use relative to other web hosting sites that provide comparable service features.

            1) GitHub Desktop and the latest version of the ATOM editor is downloaded
            2) A new repository is created in GitHub Desktop
            3) The chosen Bootstrap template files are downloaded into a folder with the same name as the repository
            4) The directory of the folder above is associated to the GitHub repository
            5) The code of any individual website page is opened via ATOM and any changes made to the code is saved within the editor
            6) All changes made are automatically logged in the GitHub repository in a chronological order; the changes are subsequently 'committed' to the 'master' branch within the repository.
            7) As a result, these changes will be then reflected in the web version of the page. A history tree can be accessed to keep track of all 'changes'made.
